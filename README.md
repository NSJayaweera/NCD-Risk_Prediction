Diabetes Risk Prediction System

An end-to-end machine learning-based diabetes risk prediction system that evaluates multiple classification and ensemble models to identify individuals at high risk of diabetes. The system is designed to support early detection, preventive healthcare, and real-time screening through a user-friendly web interface.

Project Overview

Diabetes is a major non-communicable disease (NCD) with increasing global prevalence. Early detection plays a vital role in preventing long-term complications. This project implements a robust machine learning pipeline that:

Cleans and preprocesses real-world health data

Addresses class imbalance using SMOTE

Trains and compares base, ensemble, and neural network models

Selects the optimal model using clinically relevant evaluation metrics

Deploys the best-performing model in a Streamlit-based web application

The system enables real-time diabetes risk prediction using clinical and lifestyle factors.
