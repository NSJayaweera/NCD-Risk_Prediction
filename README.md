**Project Description**<br>
This project aims to develop an integrated web application that leverages machine learning models to provide early, multi-disease risk assessment for Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs). The system focuses on four major NCDs:
- Heart Disease
- Chronic Kidney Disease
- Diabetes
- Osteoporosis
The application is designed to be user-friendly, providing individuals with accessible and actionable health insights to encourage proactive health management.

**Key Features**
- Multi-Disease Prediction: Four independent ML models for different NCDs
- Web-Based Interface: Intuitive dashboard for input and visualization
- Real-Time Inference: Immediate risk assessment based on user inputs
- Personalized Recommendations: Tailored health advice based on risk levels
- Explainable Results: Clear, interpretable risk presentations
